# LoginApplication

A multimodule login app to show how to apply clean code, clean architecture, flows, coroutines, dependency injection (Hilt), Compose and testing (using Mockk and Espresso).
The app is composed by 3 modules:
1. Login module: Contains all the business logic to make the login flow, including use case, repository and fake API.
2. App XML: XML UI (Android View System)
3. App Compose: Compose UI.

You can run whatever App XML or App Compose. Previews shown below.

IMPORTANT!: Because the app uses a fake API implementation, success result or fail is randomized.
